# Ultra-Marathon EDA 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of ultra-marathon race data. The analysis focuses on **athlete performance, race trends, and demographics** using Python.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [The Big Dataset of Ultra-Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running)

## 📌 Analysis Includes:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Trends in **race distances & athlete performance**
- Speed comparisons across different **age groups & genders**
- Seasonal patterns in ultra-marathon races

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- **Pandas** 🐼 - Data Manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊 - Data Visualization
- **NumPy** 🔢 - Numerical Analysis

## 📊 **Key Insights & Findings**
### **1️⃣ Race Distance & Performance**
- Runners in **shorter ultra-marathons (50mi and below)** tend to have significantly higher average speeds.
- **Longer races (100mi and above)** show greater variation in completion times due to endurance factors.

### **2️⃣ Age & Gender Trends**
- **Male runners** generally record faster speeds, but **female athletes show stronger consistency** over longer races.
- Performance **declines with age**, but **runners in their 30s tend to achieve peak speeds**.

### **3️⃣ Seasonal Influence**
- Most ultra-marathons take place in **Spring and Fall**, avoiding extreme weather conditions.
- **Summer races** tend to have **lower average speeds**, likely due to heat impacting endurance.
